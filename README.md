# Time Waveforms

A beautiful, interactive visualization that represents time as harmonious waveforms. This project combines visual aesthetics with audio synthesis, allowing users to see and hear the passage of time through elegant sine waves representing seconds, minutes, hours, and days. Built with Next.js, React, Tone.js, and P5.js, it features a minimalist UI with smooth animations, customizable frequency management, and rich, harmonic sound generation that creates a unique audio experience as time flows.
